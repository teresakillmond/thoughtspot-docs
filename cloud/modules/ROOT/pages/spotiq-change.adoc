:description: With SpotIQ change analysis, you can compare two data points for change and identify key change drivers from the underlying attribute columns

With SpotIQ change analysis, you can compare any two data points in a visualization for change and identify key change drivers from the underlying attribute columns.

SpotIQ change analysis compares data points of simple or complex measures using these aggregates:

* _Sum_
* _Count_
* _Sum over sum_, which generates 'what-if' percentage insights
* _Average_, which generates 'what-if' percentage insights
* Other functions which use a 'versus' analysis to show the absolute change grouped by different drill attributes

=== Change analysis for chart visualizations

ThoughtSpot supports change analysis for area, line, column, bar, line-column, pie, and KPI charts.
To perform this analysis, follow these steps:

. On an area, line, column, bar, line-column, pie, or KPI chart, hold down the command key (MacOS) or control key (Linux or Windows).
. Select the two columns or data points you plan to compare.
Here, we are comparing the results for the _San Francisco_ and _Atlanta_ stores. +
Note that if you are analyzing a KPI chart, you must either click the percent change label or select two points from the sparkline visualization. You cannot run change analysis on a KPI chart with no sparkline visualization.
. Select either of the columns or data points to see the dropdown menu, and select *SpotIQ analyze*.

. The SpotIQ window modal appears. Make sure that you select *Change analysis*.
. Select *Continue*.
. Select the columns for SpotIQ to compare.
By default, SpotIQ picks the most relevant columns, based on what it learned from your past activity.
. Optionally, <<advanced-change-analysis,customize the analysis parameters>>.
. Select *Analyze*.

ThoughtSpot supports contextual change analysis for area, line, column, bar, line-column, pie, and KPI charts. You do not need SpotIQ privileges to run contextual change analysis.

To perform this analysis, follow these steps:

. On an area, line, column, bar, line-column, pie, or KPI chart, hold down the command key (MacOS) or control key (Linux or Windows).
. Select the two columns or data points you plan to compare. +
Note that if you are analyzing a KPI chart, you must either click the percent change label or select two points from the sparkline visualization. You cannot run change analysis on a KPI chart with no sparkline visualization.

. Right-click to see the dropdown menu, and select *Run change analysis*.

. The SpotIQ window modal appears with the results of your analysis.
By default, SpotIQ picks the top 5 most relevant columns, based on what it learned from your past activity.
+

+
To select other columns to analyze, click *Manage attributes* in the lower left corner of the window and select the desired column from the window that appears.
+
NOTE: Each colored section of a SpotIQ insight represents a statistically significant outlier among the values of your chosen columns.

. You can now examine each visualization of the analysis for details of comparison.

. You can add the specific visualization to an existing Liveboard, or create a new Liveboard and add it there.

. You can run another round of SpotIQ analysis, download the data as a CSV file, edit this visualization, or make a copy of the visualization.

[#advanced-change-analysis]
== Advanced change analysis in SpotIQ

ThoughtSpot ships with a number of comparative algorithms.
Using the *Advanced* option of SpotIQ, you can adjust the parameters of the analysis, or choose a different comparative algorithm for your data.

After selecting the relevant analysis columns, click *Customize parameters*.

Under *Select Algorithms*, select the name of the algorithm.
You may have several options available, or only a single one.
In this example, the only valid option is *Change Analysis*.

Under *Refine parameters for change*, adjust the options.
In this example, the algorithm parameters are *Maximum Difference Elements*, *Max Fraction*, *Min Abs Change Ratio*, and *Min Change Ratio*.
