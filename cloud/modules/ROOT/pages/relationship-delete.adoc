:description: You can delete a relationship between tables through the ThoughtSpot application.


You can delete a relationship or join between tables through the ThoughtSpot application.
You must have either the xref:groups-privileges.adoc[*Can administer ThoughtSpot* or the *Can manage data* privilege] to delete a relationship.
If you are not an administrator, you also need edit permissions on the table, view, or worksheet.

== Delete a relationship

To delete a relationship from the Web interface:

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Find the origin table, worksheet or view of the join you want to delete through browsing, Search, or selecting the appropriate Tag(s).
. Click the name of the data source from which you want to remove the relationship.
. Click *Joins*.
You will see the list showing existing joins.
If you want to delete an external join from a worksheet, you must click *Joins within this worksheet* and choose *Joins from this worksheet*.

== Reverse join cardinality
You can use the delete functionality to reverse or change the join cardinality for a join that has dependents. Delete the join, and create it again with the opposite cardinality. Deleting the join does *not* delete the dependent objects.

If a join does not have dependents, you can change the join cardinality by xref:relationship-create.adoc#join-edit[editing the join]. This allows you to change a many-to-one join to one-to-one. To reverse the join cardinality, you must delete the join and create it again with the opposite cardinality.
