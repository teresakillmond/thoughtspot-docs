This guide provides information for application administrators.

Before addressing the major components of this guide, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the general top-level link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/architecture/components.html[architecture] of the ThoughtSpot service.

Administrators are responsible for many facets of the ThoughtSpot service.
They are most frequently in charge of these common processes:

* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html[Managing users and groups]
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-security/about-security.html[Security]
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/system-admin/sysadmin-overview.html[System administration]
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/backup-restore/choose-strategy.html[Backup and Restore]

Additionally, administrators are often involved in the following workflows:

* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-modeling/about-data-modeling-intro.html[Data modeling]
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/about-worksheets.html[Using worksheets] to simplify search
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/about-query-on-query.html[Using views] for 'stacked' search;
note that starting with Release 5.2, you can accomplish some aspects of search stacking by using the `IN` keyword (See https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/complex-search/in-keyword-searches.html).
