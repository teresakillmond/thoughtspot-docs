= Create, edit, or delete a user
:last_updated: 5/14/2020

For each unique person who accesses ThoughtSpot, you must create a user account. When you create a user manually in ThoughtSpot, you continue to manage that user in ThoughtSpot.

You can create users directly in ThoughtSpot, or import users and user groups through LDAP or similar protocols.

For users who have access through LDAP, the LDAP installation manages all user information.

[#add-user]
== Create a user in ThoughtSpot

This procedure demonstrates how to create a user manually.
When you create a user, you can specify the xref:username[_username_], xref:display-name[_display name_], xref:sharing-visibility[_sharing visibility_], the xref:password[_password_], xref:email[_email_], whether they get a xref:welcome-email[_welcome email_] and its xref:email-text[_text_], and assign xref:groups[_group_] memberships.
The user inherits privileges and permissions directly from the group assignments.

Note that all users automatically belong to the group *All*.

To create a new user and assign that user to groups, follow these steps:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Click the *Admin* icon, on the top navigation bar.
+
image::click-admin.png[Admin tab]

. In the *Admin* panel, click *User Management*.
+
image::admin-user-management.png[Admin > User Management]

. In the *User Management* section, click *Users*.
+
image::admin-user-management-users.png[Manage Groups]

. Click the *+ Add User* button on the upper right-hand side of the list of users.
