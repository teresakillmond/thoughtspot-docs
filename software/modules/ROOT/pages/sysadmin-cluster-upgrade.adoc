NOTE: This article teaches you how to upgrade a single-node, ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS cluster. To upgrade multi-node clusters, or clusters that use customer-managed xref:rhel.adoc[RHEL], xref:rhel.adoc[OEL], or xref:al2.adoc[Amazon Linux 2], contact {support-url}.

== About cluster upgrades and patches
ThoughtSpot is installed or updated from a release tarball that contains the ThoughtSpot application (binaries and configuration), third-party software, and Operating System image.
Third party software includes licensed software components necessary for operation of the ThoughtSpot application.
These include Java, Boost C{pp} libraries, Google protocol buffers, and so on.

ThoughtSpot patches the Operating System at the time of upgrades.
Installation and upgrade use the same process, replacing the older OS image on a node by the new image delivered in the release tarball.

ThoughtSpot Support will contact you to schedule an update when a minor or major upgrade becomes available.

// is this last sentence still true

== View available releases

NOTE: This feature is now deprecated. You may not use it starting with the 7.2.1 release. For details, see xref:deprecation.adoc[Deprecation Announcements].

You can also view available releases from the Admin Console.
To view new releases, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Upgrade* from the side navigation bar that appears.

The *Upgrade* page shows your cluster's current version, and any new releases that are available.

== Upgrade a cluster
To upgrade your cluster, follow these steps:

NOTE: If any commands return errors, warnings, or failures while you upgrade, contact {support-url}.

[#upgrade-step-1]
=== Step 1: Download the release
Download the release, including any patches for the version you are installing, and move it to a folder in your ThoughtSpot node.

. Navigate to [LINK].
. Download the release content folder for the version you would like to upgrade to. [i'm not sure what this actually looks like on egnyte]
. In your terminal application, `ssh` into your cluster.
Run `ssh admin@<ThoughtSpotnodeIP>`.
+
Replace `ThoughtSpotnodeIP` with your specific network information.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ ssh admin@<ThoughtSpotnodeIP>
----
. Copy the downloaded release bundle from your Downloads folder to any path in the `/export` folder of your ThoughtSpot node that has enough space. Use one of two methods:
+
* Use any secure copy method, such as `winscp`.
* If your ThoughtSpot cluster allows access to Egnyte, you can use the following `wget` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ wget -O <release-bundle-name> <EGNYTE LINK THAT I WILL PROVIDE WHEN I HAVE IT>
----

[#upgrade-step-2]
=== Step 2: Check disk space
. Check disk space by running `df -h`. `/tmp` needs at least 21 GB free for upgrades.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ df -h
----
+
The output of this command shows all disks in the ThoughtSpot node and their availability, in percentage and in number of GB.

[#upgrade-step-3]
=== Step 3: Take manual snapshot and backup
. Take a manual snapshot of the cluster. For information on how to take a manual snapshot, refer to xref:snapshots.adoc#manual-snapshot[Work with snapshots].

. Take a manual backup of the cluster. For information on how to take a manual backup, refer to xref:backup-manual.adoc[Create a manual backup].

[#upgrade-step-4]
=== Step 4: Check cluster health and release integrity
. Run `tscli cluster status`. This tells you what version you are currently on, and ensures that the cluster is running and ready.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ tscli cluster status
----
+
Make sure that the output says `Cluster: RUNNING`, `Database: READY`, and `Search Engine: READY`.

. Run `tscli cluster check` to ensure there are no component failures.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ tscli cluster check
----
+
Make sure that the output for each component is `SUCCESS`.

. Run `./capture_cluster_information.sh`. This provides {support-url} with information about your cluster in case of upgrade or post-upgrade failures.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ ./capture_cluster_information.sh
----

. Check the integrity of the release by running the `md5sum -c <MD5checksum file>` command. Replace `MD5checksum file` with the name of the checksum file in your release bundle.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ md5sum -c <MD5checksum file>
----
+
The output should be a green `OK`.

. If `tscli cluster status`, `tscli cluster check`, or the `md5sum` command return any errors, warnings, or failures, contact {support-url} before you proceed with the upgrade.

[#upgrade-step-5]
=== Step 5: Upgrade the cluster
. Launch a screen session. Use screen to ensure that your installation does not stop if you lose network connectivity.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ screen -S upgrade
----
. Run `tscli cluster update <release-number>.tar.gz`. This may take about one hour.
+
Note the following parameters:

`release-number`:: is the release number of your ThoughtSpot installation, such as `6.0`, `5.3`, `5.3.1`, and so on.

. During the upgrade process, the node reboots. The node reboot logs you out of the node. Wait about 15 minutes before you `ssh` back in. If the `ssh` output says something similar to `Connection refused`, the node is still rebooting.

. If you run into an error during upgrade, and the upgrade fails, refer to <<error-recovery,Error recovery>>.

. To see which step the upgrade is in, run `tscli cluster status --tail`. When the upgrade is complete, the output of this command says that the upgrade is complete.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ tscli cluster status --tail
----
+
NOTE: During the upgrade process, some services may temporarily be unavailable. Their status in the `tscli cluster status --tail` command might be `FAILURE`. The service should return to `SUCCESS` as the upgrade continues. If a service continues to fail, xref:support-contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support].

. The upgrade takes about 1.5 hours to complete, including the objects upgrader.

[#upgrade-step-6]
=== Step 6: Finalize installation
. After the upgrade completes, log out of the shell.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ logout
----

. `SSH` back into the cluster.
Run `ssh admin@<ThoughtSpotnodeIP>`.
+
Replace `ThoughtSpotnodeIP` with your specific network information.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ ssh admin@<ThoughtSpotnodeIP>
----

. To check that the cluster is ready, run `tscli cluster status`.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ tscli cluster status
----
+
Ensure that the `DATABASE` and `SEARCH ENGINE` fields in the `tscli cluster status` command show `READY`.

. Run `tscli cluster check` to ensure there are no component failures.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ tscli cluster check
----
+
Make sure that the output for each component is `SUCCESS`.

. Sign into the ThoughtSpot application on your browser.

[#upgrade-step-7]
=== Step 7: Apply patches
Your release bundle may include patches for the ThoughtSpot application. These patches update services and provide bug fixes. If your release bundle included any patches, <<patch,apply the patches>>.

[#patch]
== Patch a cluster
To patch your cluster, follow these steps:
[cols="5,~",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
| &#10063; | <<patch-step-1,Step 1: Obtain cluster patch>>
| &#10063; | <<patch-step-2,Step 2: Verify patch integrity>>
| &#10063; | <<patch-step-3,Step 3: Apply the patch to the cluster>>
| &#10063; | <<patch-step-4,Step 4: Finalize installation>>
|===

[#patch-step-1]
=== Step 1: Obtain cluster patch
Download the patch or patches for the version you are running, and move it to a folder in your ThoughtSpot node. If you just upgraded to a new version, the release bundle you downloaded and copied to your ThoughtSpot node should contain the patches you need to apply.

. Navigate to [LINK].
. Download the release content folder or patch folder for the version you are running. [i'm not sure what this actually looks like on egnyte]
. In your terminal application, `ssh` into your cluster.
Run `ssh admin@<ThoughtSpotnodeIP>`.
+
Replace `ThoughtSpotnodeIP` with your specific network information.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ ssh admin@<ThoughtSpotnodeIP>
----
. Copy the downloaded release or patch bundle from your Downloads folder to any path in the `/export` folder of your ThoughtSpot node that has enough space. Use one of two methods:
+
* Use any secure copy method, such as `winscp`.
* If your ThoughtSpot cluster allows access to Egnyte, you can use the following `wget` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ wget -O <release-bundle-name> <EGNYTE LINK THAT I WILL PROVIDE WHEN I HAVE IT>
----

[#patch-step-2]
=== Step 2: Verify patch integrity
To verify the integrity of the patch files, check the checksum for each patch.

Run `md5sum -c <patch-name>.tar.gz.MD5checksum`.

[source,bash]
----
 $ md5sum -c <patch-name>.tar.gz.MD5checksum
----

Your output says `ok` if you have the correct release.

[#patch-step-3]
=== Step 3: Apply the patch to the cluster
Run `tscli patch apply <patch-name>` for each patch.
[source,bash]
----
 $ tscli patch apply <patch-name
----
The patch process takes about 10 minutes.

[#patch-step-4]
=== Step 4: Finalize installation
Ensure that ThoughtSpot applied the patches successfully.

Run `tscli patch ls` and look for the new patch names.

[source,bash]
----
 $ tscli patch ls
----

[#error-recovery]
== Error recovery

During the upgrade process, after you run `tscli cluster update`, the upgrade may fail with a message similar to `Update failed for cluster <cluster-name>`.

. Run the following command to resume the upgrade:
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ tscli cluster resume-update
----
. If that command does not work, or if the upgrade fails again, contact {support-url}.
