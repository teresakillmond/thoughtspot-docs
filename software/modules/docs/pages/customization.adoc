= Custom SpotIQ analysis
:last_updated: 11/25/2020


Learn how to customize SpotIQ analysis.

Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis.
The customized analysis can be a one-time customization or can apply to all future analysis of that particular data source.

== Finding customization controls

Every menu or location where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can customize your analysis.
You access it using the lightbulb button image:icon-lightbulb.png[more options menu icon] or the ellipses menu image:icon-ellipses.png[SpotIQ analyze icon].

Regardless of where you run *SpotIQ analyze* in ThoughtSpot, the *SpotIQ* window has the same layout.
The columns displayed, though, are specific to the data from which you run *SpotIQ analyze*.

This window has two tabs:

* *Columns*, where you can explicitly indicate which columns to include in a SpotIQ analysis.
(You can select all, some, or none.)
* *Advanced*, where you can run custom analyses and incorporate R scripts into SpotIQ.

The *Advanced* tab has many options.
The panel scrolls, so more algorithms are available than appear in the following image

The *SpotIQ* insights page has an option to open this window to customize a single analysis.

The *Tell us more* window provides information on how to exclude a value from all future analysis.

== Eliminate null values

Null values should be eliminated from your analysis.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++In the Search bar, add a filter +++<code>++++++<i>+++column+++</i>+++!= Null+++</code>+++ to the search bar. Or choose +++<b>+++Exclude null values from current analysis+++</b>+++, using the +++<b>+++Advanced+++</b>+++ panel.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Set +++<b>+++Exclude null values from my analysis+++</b>+++ on your user +++<b>+++Profile+++</b>+++ to exclude them from any future  SpotIQ analyses you do.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Exclude uninteresting column(s) in insight

You should always exclude columns you are not interested from your analysis.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++Use the +++<b>+++EXCLUDE+++</b>+++ option of +++<b>+++SPOTIQ PREFERENCE+++</b>+++ under the +++<b>+++DATA+++</b>+++ tab to exclude any column permanently from all future analysis.+++</p>++++++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Include an interesting column

You can always include columns that interest you in your analysis.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++Choose +++<b>+++Customize analysis+++</b>+++ and select columns that you want to include.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Ensure +++<b>+++Index Priority+++</b>+++ is between 8-10 on the column under the +++<b>+++DATA+++</b>+++ tab.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Remove known date outliers

Your data may contain known outliers.
For example, you are in the middle of a quarter and only want to analyze the previous quarter.
Anything from the present quarter could contain an outlier.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++In the Search bar, add a filter +++<code>++++++<i>+++date+++</i>+++< last time period+++</code>+++ to the search bar.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Not applicable.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Too few insights

Your SpotIQ analysis may not provide you as many insights as you think it should.+++<table style="border:1px;">++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++Choose +++<b>+++Customize analysis+++</b>+++, select the +++<b>+++Advanced+++</b>+++ tab, and decrease the +++<b>+++Multiplier for Outlier Detection+++</b>+++ to a value closer to zero.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Not applicable.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Explaining Anomaly Insights

When SpotIQ finds insights with anomaly points, you have the option to run the Explain Insight command to have SpotIQ do further analysis on the anomaly points.
